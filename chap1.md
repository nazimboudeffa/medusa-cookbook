# Install the Medusa Server

On the VM

MedusaJS is a powerful JavaScript framework for building web applications, and getting started with it is relatively easy. In this article, we will go over the steps to install MedusaJS server and set up a new project.

Before we begin, please make sure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can check this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
node -v
npm -v
```
If these commands return a version number, then Node.js and npm are installed and ready to use. If not, you can download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install MedusaJS server by running the following command:

```npm install -g medusajs```
The -g flag tells npm to install MedusaJS globally on your machine, which means that you will be able to use the medusajs command from any directory.

After the installation is complete, you can create a new MedusaJS project by running the following command:

```
medusajs new my-project
```
This will create a new directory called my-project with the basic structure of a MedusaJS project. You can then navigate to this directory and start the server by running the following command:

```
cd my-project
medusajs start
```
The server will start and you can access your new MedusaJS application by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Finally, you can also use medusajs generate command to generate a new resource, medusajs build command to build your production code, medusajs test command to test your code, and many more.

In conclusion, installing MedusaJS server is a straightforward process that only requires Node.js and npm to be installed. With the help of MedusaJS command line tool, you can easily set up a new project and start building your web application.
