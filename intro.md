# What you're going to learn with this book

In this CookBook we are mainly going to install Medusa Server in Ubuntu VM from VirtualBox for developement and then we're going to use Ubuntu server in a VPS for production 
it's what I use for my deployment

But for those who want to use the server on other systems we're going to see some examples on Heroku, Netlify, Railways and Digital Ocean
