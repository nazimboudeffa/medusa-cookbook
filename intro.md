In this book, we will explore the features and capabilities of MedusaJS, and show you how to use it to build dynamic and responsive web applications that are easy to maintain and scale. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting out, this book will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to create professional-grade web applications with MedusaJS.

MedusaJS is a modern JavaScript framework that emphasizes on building high-performance and scalable web applications. Some of the key concepts in MedusaJS include components, routes, services, and models. Components are the building blocks of MedusaJS and allow developers to create reusable and modular UI elements. Routes are used to handle client-side navigation and map URLs to specific components. Services are used to encapsulate business logic and share it across the application, and models are used to handle data and interact with the backend. MedusaJS also provides advanced features such as forms, validators, events, interceptors, and testing which help developers to build complex web applications.

# What you're going to learn with this book

In this CookBook we are mainly going to install Medusa Server in Ubuntu VM from VirtualBox for developement and then we're going to use Ubuntu server in a VPS for production 
it's what I use for my deployment

But for those who want to use the server on other systems we're going to see some examples on Heroku, Netlify, Railways and Digital Ocean
