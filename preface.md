# Introduction

I have joined the Medusa community in october 2022 just after the hacktober fest, didn't have time to join before

It's been amazing to see a young startup beeing funded with 8M$ in a first round

I've started to answer questions like I have done in the Phaser community, see [my Phaser v2 CookBook](https://github.com/nazimboudeffa/phaser2-cookbook)

Some times after I have been contacted by the team in dm to be rewarded with [some swags](https://www.instagram.com/p/CneZYzFM3BD/)

Right after I have launched my project to write this guide all along with my journey in the MedusaJS project

# What you're going to learn with this book

In this CookBook we are mainly going to install Medusa Server in Ubuntu VM from VirtualBox for developement and then we're going to use Ubuntu server in a VPS for production 
it's what I use for my deployment

But for those who want to use the server on other systems we're going to see some examples on Heroku, Netlify, Railways and Digital Ocean
