# History and My Journey

I have joined the Medusa community in october 2022 just after the hacktober fest, didn't have time to join before

It's been amazing to see a young startup beeing funded with 8M$ in a first round

I've started to answer questions like I have done in the Phaser community, see [my Phaser v2 CookBook](https://github.com/nazimboudeffa/phaser2-cookbook)

Some times after I have been contacted by the team in dm to be rewarded with [some swags](https://www.instagram.com/p/CneZYzFM3BD/)

Right after I have launched my project to write this guide all along with my journey in the MedusaJS project
